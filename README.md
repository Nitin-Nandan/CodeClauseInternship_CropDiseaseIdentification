## Introduction

**Crop Disease Identification** is a deep learning web application built for the CodeClause Internship (Golden Level) by Nitin Nandan. The project aims to help farmers identify crop diseases through image uploads and deep learning based analysis.

---

## Features

* Simple UI for uploading crop images.
* Automated disease identification using state-of-the-art CNN models.
* Built with Python, Flask, and TensorFlow.
* Designed to support agricultural communities with accessible technology.

---

## Prerequisites

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) (with [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python), [Pylance](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance), and [Jupyter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) extensions)
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Set VS Code's default terminal to Command Prompt (`cmd`) for smoothest experience.
    * Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open the Command Palette.
    * Type and select, `Terminal: Select Default Profile`
    * Choose **Command Prompt** from the list of available terminals.
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win)
* [Python 3.12.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3120/) **(added to PATH)**
* [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable 2015-2022](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170#visual-studio-2015-2017-2019-and-2022)

## Environment Setup & Usage

### 1. Open Terminal in VS Code

* Open project folder.
* Go to **Terminal>New Terminal**.
* Make sure the terminal type is **Command Prompt** (not PowerShell).

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nitin-Nandan/CodeClauseInternship_CropDiseaseIdentification.git
```

```bash
cd CodeClauseInternship_CropDiseaseIdentification
```

### 3. Download the Dataset

* Download [PlantVillage](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmarex/plantdisease) dataset from Kaggle.
* Extract and move the entire `PlantVillage` folder into `CodeClauseInternship_CropDiseaseIdentification` folder.

### 4. Create a Virtual Environment

**In VS Code terminal:**
```bash
py -3.12 -m venv venv
```

* This creates a `venv` folder in your cloned directory.

### 5. Activate the Virtual Environment

**In VS Code terminal:**
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

* You should see `(venv)` at the start of your prompt.
* If you see any error make sure your terminal is set to Command Prompt, not PowerShell.

### 6. Select Python Interpreter in VS Code

* Press `Ctrl+Shift+P`, type **Python: Select Interpreter**, and choose the one showing `.\venv\Scripts\python.exe`.

### 7. Install Dependencies

**With the virtual environment activated:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 8. Run the App

**With the virtual environment still activated:**
```bash
python app.py
```

* The app should open in your browser automatically.
* If the app does not open automatically, visit the URL displayed on the terminal.

### 9. (Optional) Deactivate Virtual Environment

```bash
deactivate
```

## How to Use the App

**After you open the app using `python app.py`, follow these steps:**

### 1. Upload a Leaf Image

* Click **‚ÄúChoose File‚Äù** and select a plant leaf image (JPG/PNG, max size 2MB).
* Click **‚Äúüîç Analyze Image‚Äù** to get the prediction.

<div align="center"><img src="static/no-input.png" alt="No Input Screen" width="45%" /></div>

### 2. View the Result

* See the predicted disease with confidence score.
* Read its description and prevention tips.
* If confidence is low, the app will suggest consulting an expert.

### 3. Upload another image

* Click the **‚Äú‚¨ÜÔ∏è Upload New Image‚Äù** button to try again.

## How to Retrain the Model

**To retrain or experiment with the model:**

### 1. Open the Notebook

* Open `crop_disease_identification.ipynb` in VS Code.

### 2. Adjust Parameters

* Modify image size, batch size, model type, epochs, augmentation, etc.

### 3. Run all Cells

* The notebook guides you through data preprocessing, training, and saving.

### 4. Replace the Model

* The app automatically uses your updated `crop_disease_model.keras` file.

## FAQs

### 1. I get an error about missing classes or images?
* Ensure the `PlantVillage` folder is placed correctly in the `CodeClauseInternship_CropDiseaseIdentification` folder and contains proper class subfolders.

### 2. The app doesn‚Äôt run with `python app.py`?
* Check installation of **Python 12.0.x** using `py -3.12 --version` in VS Code terminal. Also make sure it is **added to PATH**.
* If **Python 3.12.x** is installed, try `py -3.12 app.py`.

### 3. Can I use a GPU for training or prediction?
* Yes, but the model is optimized for CPU-only use and runs well without a GPU.

### 4. How big can my image upload be?
* **Max 2MB**. Only JPG/JPEG/PNG files are accepted.
