## Prerequisites

* Visual Studio Code (with Python, Pylance, and Jupyter extensions)
* **[Recommended]** Set VS Code's default terminal to Command Prompt (`cmd`) for smoothest experience.
* Git
* Python 3.12.x (added to PATH)
* Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable 2015-2022

## Environment Setup & Usage

### 1. Open Terminal in VS Code

* Open project folder.
* Go to **Terminal>New Terminal**.
* Make sure the terminal type is **Command Prompt** (not PowerShell).

### 2. Clone the Repositry

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nitin-Nandan/CodeClauseInternship_CropDiseaseIdentification.git
```

```bash
cd CodeClauseInternship_CropDiseaseIdentification
```

### 3. Download the Dataset

* Download [PlantVillage](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmarex/plantdisease) dataset from Kaggle.
* Extract and move the entire `PlantVillage` folder into `CodeClauseInternship_CropDiseaseIdentification` folder.

### 4. Create a Virtual Environment

**In VS Code terminal:**
```bash
py -3.12 -m venv venv
```

* This creates a `venv` folder in your cloned directory.

### 5. Activate the Virtual Environment

**In VS Code terminal:**
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

* You should see `(venv)` at the start of your prompt.
* If you see any error make sure your terminal is set to Command Prompt, not PowerShell.

### 6. Select Python Interpreter in VS Code

* Press `Ctrl+Shift+P`, type **Python: Select Interpreter**, and choose the one showing `.\venv\Scripts\python.exe`.

### 7. Install Dependencies

**With the virtual environment activated:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 8. Run the App

**With the virtual environment still activated:**
```bash
python app.py
```

* The app should open in your browser automatically.
* If the app does not open automatically, visit the URL displayed on the terminal.

### 9. (Optional) Deactivate Virtual Environment

```bash
deactivate
```
